# tic-tac-toe-Odin-project
Project: Tic Tac Toe from JS path of The Odin Project


## This is an Odin Project: Tic Tac Toe

* I am expected to create a Tic Tac Toe Game, for this I will demonstrate my understanding of:

    * Factory Functions
    * Scopes
    * Closures
    * Private Variables
    * IIFE (module patterns)
    * Objects
    * Arrays

    * `The main goal is to have as little global code as possible` (which is something that I've been trying to do from the start).

* Coming from a non-Western background, Tic Tac Toe isn't as familiar to me as games like Rock, Paper, Scissors. But don't worry I'll figure it out, as always.

## Project Completion

* Initially, I thought this project would be tough because of the community's feedback. It was challenging at first, but once I figured out how to place markers in the board array's index, things became much easier. The time spent on the previous Library project proved invaluable as it helped me visualize arrays better.

* I wanted to track the scores so players can play as much as they want without worrying about who scores the highest.

* I also didn't make a strict input form for player names, as I want players to have the freedom to enter characters like <em>XLR8</em>, <em>QWERTY12</em>, etc.

## Reflection

* I gained a deeper understanding of Factory Functions and Closures, encapsulating about 95% of my variables within modules. Overall, I'm pleased to have completed the project ahead of schedule.

* In the future, when I come back to this project, I think I wanna have  a computer logic, to play against the computer. I was wondering how I might be able to do that, perhaps:
    ``
        if board[index] is occupied with 'X'
    computer occupies board[index] adjacent to 'X' to prevent 'X' from winning.
    ``

    And some more if-else statement for computer to win the game.
