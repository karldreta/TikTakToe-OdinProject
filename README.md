# tic-tac-toe-Odin-project
Project: Tic Tac Toe from JS path of The Odin Project


## This is an Odin Project: Tic Tac Toe

* I am expected to create a Tic Tac Toe Game, for this I will demonstrate my understanding of:

    * Factory Functions
    * Scopes
    * Closures
    * Private Variables
    * IIFE (module patterns)
    * Objects
    * Arrays

    * `The main goal is to have as little global code as possible` (which is something that I've been trying to do from the start).

* Coming from a non-Western background, Tic Tac Toe isn't as familiar to me as games like Rock, Paper, Scissors. But don't worry I'll figure it out, as always.
